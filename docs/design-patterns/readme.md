| Design Pattern          | Brief Description                                                                                   | .NET / ASP.NET Core / Third-Party Types Examples     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Singleton               | Ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.                 | `System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection` (BCL, for connection pooling), `ILogger` in ASP.NET Core (when configured as singleton) |
| Factory Method          | Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. | `WebClient` (BCL), `HttpClientFactory` (ASP.NET Core)|
| Abstract Factory        | Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. | `DbProviderFactory` (BCL), `ILoggerFactory` (ASP.NET Core) |
| Builder                 | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations. | `StringBuilder` (BCL), `WebHostBuilder` (ASP.NET Core) |
| Prototype               | Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.                          | `ICloneable` (BCL)                                    |
| Adapter                 | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. Uses a 'wrapper' to translate calls to an interface into a different interface. | `StreamAdapter` (BCL), Various ORM adapters like `Dapper`|
| Bridge                  | Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.          | `DbConnection` (BCL), `ILogger` (ASP.NET Core)       |
| Composite               | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. | `DirectoryInfo` (BCL), `IApplicationBuilder` (ASP.NET Core) |
| Decorator               | Allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. | `Stream` (BCL, e.g., `FileStream`, `MemoryStream`), `Middleware` in ASP.NET Core |
| Fa√ßade                  | Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.                                            | `HttpClient` (BCL), `WebClient` (BCL)                |
| Flyweight               | Minimizes memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects. | `String.Intern` (BCL)                                |
| Proxy                   | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.                     | `WCF Proxy` (BCL), `IActionResult` in ASP.NET Core for action result proxies |
| Observer                | Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. | `IObservable<T>` / `IObserver<T>` (BCL), `INotifyPropertyChanged` (BCL) |
| Mediator                | Reduces coupling between classes communicating with each other by having them communicate indirectly through a mediator object. | `IMediator` in MediatR (Third-party)                |
| Iterator                | Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. | `IEnumerable` / `IEnumerator` (BCL)                 |
| Strategy                | Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. | `IComparer` / `IComparable` (BCL)                   |
| Command                 | Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. | `ICommand` in WPF (BCL), `CommandHandler` in MediatR |
| Memento                 | Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be returned to this state later. | `DataContractSerializer` (BCL) for state snapshot  |
| State                   | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. | `StateServerMode` in ASP.NET (BCL)                  |
| Visitor                 | Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure. Visitor lets a new operation be defined without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. | `ExpressionVisitor` (BCL)                           |
| Chain of Responsibility | Passes the request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving the request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. | `DelegatingHandler` in HttpClient (ASP.NET Core), Middleware in ASP.NET Core |
| Template Method         | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. | `Stream` (BCL, with methods like `Read` and `Write` that subclasses implement), `ControllerBase` in ASP.NET Core (with action methods overridden in derived controllers) |
