# Sample interview questions

Now let's review 60 commonly asked questions in .NET software engineer position interviews. 

The 60 items include a question, a good answer, and a poor answer with an explanation of why is poor. You will learn as much from reviewing poor answers as good ones.

I encourage you to get access to a whiteboard and ask a friend to read the questions to you. Answer them verbally and record your responses on video to review later. This will force you to practice writing code on a whiteboard in a stressful environment. 

As you review these sample interview questions, you will note commonalities, especially in the poor answers:
- **Oversimplification**: A poor response will oversimplify the concept, technology, or process. This is a sign that the interviewee may only have learned a few key phrases related to the question, without any deeper understanding. At a minimum, you should have written code and seen it run for any technology you get asked about. It's fine to be honest and explain that you have not implemented a technology in a real project, only in learning exercises. 
- **Unaware of Best Practices**: A poor response will often neglect the best practices in a technology area.
- **Misunderstanding**: A poor response will . It is better to acknowledge areas where you have a vaguer understanding. Most employers would rather an employee asked questions when they are unsure rather than pretend they know what they are doing!
Creating a comprehensive list of topics for a .NET software engineer interview can help candidates prepare effectively and ensure interviewers cover all necessary aspects of .NET development. The following is a detailed set of topics that could be asked about during such an interview.

1. [.NET CLI tools](q01.md). "Can you explain the role of .NET CLI tools in the development process? Please provide examples of how you would use these tools to manage a .NET project throughout its lifecycle."
2. [Git fundamentals](q02.md). "Can you explain the fundamental concepts and commands of Git that every .NET developer should know? How would these Git operations be used in a typical development workflow?"
